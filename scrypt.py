# Step 1: Data Collection
# Assuming you have historical Bitcoin price data in a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('bitcoin_prices.csv')
# Add additional relevant data, such as technical indicators, sentiment analysis, etc.

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary transformations

# Step 3: Feature Engineering
# Extract relevant features from the data and create feature matrix X and target variable y

# Step 4: Split Data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Model Training
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
y_pred_train = model.predict(X_train)
train_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred_train))
y_pred_test = model.predict(X_test)
test_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_test))

# Step 7: Future Price Prediction
# Assuming you have a new sample for prediction in new_sample dataframe
predicted_price = model.predict(new_sample)

# Step 8: Web Page Development
# Develop a web page with an interface to select the date and time range
# Use a server-side framework like Flask or Django to handle user inputs and trigger predictions

# Step 9: Display Predictions
# Display the predicted Bitcoin prices on the web page

# Additional Steps: Model Fine-tuning and Validation
# Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and architecture using techniques like grid search or cross-validation
# Validate the model's performance using various evaluation metrics and techniques
